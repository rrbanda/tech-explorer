# Platform Migration Use Cases

## PCF to Container Platform Migration

### Overview
Platform Cloud Foundry (PCF) to modern container platform migration represents a critical modernization initiative for enterprise organizations. This migration enables organizations to leverage advanced containerization technologies while maintaining application functionality and improving operational efficiency.

### Migration Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Lift and Shift Migration
- **Approach**: Minimal application changes with focus on platform compatibility
- **Timeline**: 3-6 months for medium-scale applications
- **Tools**: Dolly migration toolkit for automated artifact generation
- **Outcome**: Rapid migration with immediate containerization benefits

#### Scenario 2: Modernization Migration
- **Approach**: Application refactoring with cloud-native patterns
- **Timeline**: 6-12 months for comprehensive modernization
- **Tools**: ECS platform with development tools and frameworks
- **Outcome**: Full cloud-native architecture with enhanced capabilities

#### Scenario 3: Hybrid Migration
- **Approach**: Phased migration with gradual modernization
- **Timeline**: 12-18 months for complex enterprise applications
- **Tools**: Combination of Dolly and manual refactoring
- **Outcome**: Balanced approach with risk mitigation and modernization

### Technology Recommendations

#### Primary Platform: ECS
- **Rationale**: Proven track record for PCF migrations
