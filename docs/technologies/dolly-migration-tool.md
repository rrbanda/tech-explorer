# Dolly - PCF Migration Tool

## Overview
CX Dolly is a comprehensive tactical toolkit designed to accelerate and simplify the migration of microservices from Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) to Enterprise Container Service (ECS). It provides a near zero-touch migration experience while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Key Features
- **Automated Migration**: Fully automated artifact generation and boilerplate code creation
- **Zero Code Changes**: Minimal to no source code modifications required
- **Backward Compatibility**: Code remains deployable in both PCF and OpenShift
- **Pipeline Integration**: Pre-populated artifacts for Unify and Lightspeed pipelines
- **Technology Agnostic**: Supports multiple programming languages and frameworks

## Migration Process
1. **Assessment**: Application analysis and migration feasibility study
2. **Planning**: Migration strategy and timeline development
3. **Artifact Generation**: Automated creation of deployment artifacts
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing in target environment
5. **Deployment**: Seamless deployment with rollback capabilities
6. **Validation**: Post-migration validation and performance tuning

## Supported Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, Go
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, .NET Core, Express.js, Flask, Gin
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **Message Queues**: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, Redis Pub/Sub
